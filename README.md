# audiovate-community
The community contribution version of our audio visualizer

Welcome to the community contribution version of our audio player. In order to run the project on your local machine clone this repository, cd into
the root directory and run npm install. The start script is set to nodemon start so you will want to have nodemon installed, but the app can also be
started by entering node index.js in the terminal prompt.

Once the app is running there are some basic controls:
- The music note button will open a window to load audio files (mp3, wav, ogg).
- The image button will allow you to load a background image.
- Music plays / pauses using the audio controls.
